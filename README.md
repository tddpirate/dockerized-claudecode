# dockerized-claudecode - Claude Code Docker Setup

A secure Docker environment for running Claude Code on your projects with filesystem isolation.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A project directory you want to work on
- Anthropic API key OR Claude Pro/Max subscription

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

1. Make the setup script executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup-and-run.sh
```

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup-and-run.sh
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Prompt you for your project directory
- ‚úÖ Validate the directory exists
- ‚úÖ Create the `.env` configuration file
- ‚úÖ Optionally save your API key
- ‚úÖ Build the Docker image
- ‚úÖ Start the container
- ‚úÖ Drop you into an interactive shell

3. Inside the container, start Claude Code:
```bash
claude
```

### Method 2: Manual Setup

1. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
PROJECT_DIR=/absolute/path/to/your/project
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

2. Build and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec claude-code bash
```

3. Inside the container, run Claude Code:
```bash
claude
```

## üîê Security Features

### Filesystem Isolation
- Your project is mounted at `/workspace` inside the container
- Claude Code **cannot** access files outside this directory on your host
- Host system files (like `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`) are **not** accessible
- Perfect for working on untrusted or experimental code

### Resource Limits
The container is configured with:
- CPU limit: 2 cores
- Memory limit: 4GB
- Memory reservation: 1GB

Adjust these in `docker-compose.yml` as needed.

### Network Isolation (Optional)
To completely disable network access (maximum security):
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml, uncomment:
network_mode: none
```

**Note:** This will prevent Claude Code from accessing the Anthropic API. Use only for offline testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Container Management

### Start the container
```bash
docker-compose start
docker-compose exec claude-code bash
```

### Stop the container
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Restart the container
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Rebuild after changes
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## üìÅ Working with Multiple Projects

To switch to a different project:

1. Stop the current container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

2. Update the `.env` file with the new project path:
```bash
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/different/project
```

3. Start the container again:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec claude-code bash
```

**Alternative:** Run the setup script again to interactively choose a new project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env file)

- **PROJECT_DIR**: Absolute path to your project directory (required)
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Your Anthropic API key (optional if using OAuth)
- **ANTHROPIC_MODEL**: Claude model to use (default: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Claude Code Settings

Settings are persisted in a Docker volume (`claude-settings`). To configure permissions:

1. Inside the container, create `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "Bash(docker:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Or use the interactive command:
```bash
claude
/permissions
```

## üîß Authentication

### Option 1: OAuth (Recommended)
1. Run `claude` in the container
2. Follow the OAuth flow in your browser
3. Choose Claude Pro/Max subscription or API

### Option 2: API Key
Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your `.env` file before starting the container.

## üì¶ What's Installed

The container includes:
- Node.js 20 (Alpine Linux)
- Claude Code CLI (latest version)
- Git
- Python 3
- Common development tools (bash, curl, vim, nano)
- SSH client
- Build tools (gcc, make, etc.)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Project directory not found"
Ensure you're using the **absolute path** to your project:
```bash
# Good
PROJECT_DIR=/home/username/projects/myapp

# Bad (relative paths don't work)
PROJECT_DIR=./myapp
PROJECT_DIR=~/projects/myapp
```

### "Permission denied" accessing files
The container runs as root by default. If you encounter permission issues:
```bash
# On host, make files readable
chmod -R a+r /path/to/project

# For write access
chmod -R a+rw /path/to/project
```

### Container won't start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

# Rebuild from scratch
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Claude Code authentication fails
1. Ensure you have internet access (unless using `network_mode: none`)
2. Try setting the API key in `.env` instead of OAuth
3. Check your API key is valid at https://console.anthropic.com/

## üéØ Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Safe for:
- Testing Claude Code on unfamiliar projects
- Working on open-source code
- Experimenting with AI-generated code
- Learning Claude Code features
- CI/CD pipelines (with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider alternatives for:
- Projects requiring access to host SSH keys
- Projects needing host environment variables
- Workflows requiring host Docker access
- Projects with database connections on host

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Always use Git** in your project directory for easy rollback
2. **Review changes** before committing Claude Code's modifications
3. **Start with plan mode** to understand what Claude wants to do
4. **Set permission denials** for sensitive files in settings.json
5. **Limit resources** appropriately in docker-compose.yml
6. **Regular backups** of your project directory
